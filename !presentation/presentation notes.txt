GENERAL HYPOTHESIS:	There would be some obvious correlation between cases and deaths per capita/mortality rate, and each variable examined in our presentation.

	MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME
		OUTCOME:	Median household income has little to no effect on cases.
		ANALYSIS:	

	POPULATION BELOW POVERTY LINE
		OUTCOME:	Poverty line has no effect.
		ANALYSIS:	XYZ

	POPULATION OVER AGE 65
		OUTCOME:	Less populated areas experienced lower impacts.
		ANALYSIS:	Already established isolated lifestyles likely contributed to lower per capita rates.

	POPULATION DENSITY
		OUTCOME:	Definitely more prevalent in populated counties
		ANALYSIS:	Obvious.

	UNINSURED POPULATION
		OUTCOME:	Far lower rates than expected.
		ANALYSIS:	Uninsured populations are less likely to be tested and therefore diagnosed.  May also be exhibiting especially careful behaviors, given threat.
