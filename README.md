# "Show Me" Covid Data! | 2020


## Examining the rates of Covid-19 across popultions in the counties of Missiouri

Group Project 1 involved choosing a dataset from an external source, using Python to process the data, and performing analysis based on generated visualizations. 


Some of the variables that we used were **population density**, **median income**, **percent of population over 65**, **percent of population withouth health insurance**, and **percent of population under the poverty line**. We used this information to compare cases, deaths and mortality rates across Missouri.

Initally, we had too much data, but settled for a local source, SLU Professor Chris Prener, PhD. We also pulled county size and insurance from health.mo.gov and meric.mo.go. We also pulled data from covidcountydata.org and the U.S. Census County list as the covidcountydata.org did not have county names, but used FIPS. The U.S. Census provided the FIPS data so that we could find out the names of each county.

## Conclusions:

There were several shortcomings of our project, primarily the lack of individual result analysis and comparison to state, region, national, and global metrics
Even with the flaws of our study, the results show that COVID-19 does not discriminate.

However, we postulate that correlation was not presented due to the following:
Age above 65: Population not venturing into public for potential exposure
Uninsured: Without insurance, population less likely to seek medical attention i.e. COVID-19 testing
Median Income: As a group, we supposed that the poverty line variable would have been more significant and more accurate than median income, but that did not prove out. Most likely due to a potential correlation with uninsured rate (another gap in the study)
