Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:

* The kind of data you'd like to work with/field you're interested in (e.g., geodata, weather data, etc.)
  - Health data (specifically COVID-19-related), locally relevant (St. Louis Metro and/or Missouri and/or Midwest)

* The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data
  - Is there a relationship between:
      - Testing and Demographic Information? (race, gender, income, education, age, religion, employment etc.)
      - Positive Results and Demographic Information?
      - Mortality and Demographic Information?
      - Testing/Positive/Mortality and nearby health facilities

* Possible source for such data
    -https://github.com/slu-openGIS/MO_HEALTH_Covid_Tracking
    -New York Times
    -https://meric.mo.gov/data

In other words, write down what kind of data you plan to work with, and what kinds of questions you'd like to ask of it. This constitutes your Project Proposal/Outline, and should look something like this:

* Our project is to uncover patterns in COVID-19 activity around Missouri. We'll examine relationships between demographic identifiers and COVID-19 tests/results/outcomes; trends in testing, results, and mortality over the course of the pandemic; and related questions, as the data admits.
